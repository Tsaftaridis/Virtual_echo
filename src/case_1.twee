:: Case 1 introduction 
Mr. Joseph is a 65-year-old man from the village of Boucan Ferdinand who was brought to the hospital by his son. His son describes that he has been suffering from shortness of breath ("souf kout") for a few days, but he didn't want to go to the hospital and tried to treat himself using his old family remedy made of honey, Aloe Vera, and almond leaves.

Mr. Joseph says that his symptoms are caused by "evil spirits" and doesn't seek medical care unless it's a life-or-death situation. He also says that yesterday he was coughing during the night and couldn't sleep.

Remember that a physical examination is important when first approaching a patient. After that, an echocardiogram and an ECG are necessary diagnostic steps before moving on to treatment in this patient.

The head nurse asks you which of the following would be the best initial treatment option for this patient:

[[IV Furosemide|Furosemide IV 1]]
[[Oral loop diuretic|Bad outcome 1]]
[[1.5 L of Lactated Ringer's (no NaCl) and 10 mg of IV metoprolol|Very bad outcome 1]]

:: Furosemide IV 1
After starting high-dose IV furosemide, the patient reports improvement in symptoms. He is able to breathe better and lie flat. He thanks you. His blood pressure has normalized.

IV furosemide is the correct first choice in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure, according to international guidelines.
<<set $case_1_Tx_score += 4 >>
[[Continue|Further management 1]]

:: Bad outcome 1
Mr. Joseph improves slowly over the following days. During his hospital stay, he still complains of dyspnea for the next five days "souf li wo" when trying to walk to the bathroom, although his peripheral edema seems to be slowly improving.
On the 6th day, he is finally asymptomatic according to him.

<<set $case_1_Tx_score += 3 >>
[[Continue|Further management 1]]

:: Very bad outcome 1
3 hours later, you are called by the nurse because the patient "doesn't seem to be doing well." Mr. Joseph's blood pressure is 90/70 mmHg, his heart rate is 140 bpm, and his extremities are pale and cold to the touch.

Mr. Joseph is admitted to intensive care for further management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction complicated by cardiogenic shock.


<img style='width: 100%' src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG.ZCGoOne7gjb9cVeeQ5SV?pid=ImgGn&rs=1">

After 5 days in the intensive care unit, his symptoms and vital signs improve, and he is transferred back to the regular ward.
<<set $case_1_Tx_score -= 4 >>
[[Continue|Further management 1]]

:: Further management 1
You examine Mr. Joseph and discuss his symptoms with him. He reports that he feels better and no longer has "Pye anfle" (swollen feet). During the examination, you confirm that the edema has disappeared and lung sounds are normal.

The attending physician comes to ask you what would be the next step in the management of Mr. Joseph.

[[Discharge home on oral diuretics|Discharge home 1]]
[[Keep in hospital for further management|Hospitalization and monitoring 1]]

:: Discharge home 1
According to guidelines, it is advised to hospitalize and monitor patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Oral diuretic treatment may not be sufficient to control their heart failure. Additionally, since this patient traveled a long way to the hospital, he may be lost to follow-up and needs to be put on heart failure treatment before leaving.

<<set $case_1_Fu_score -= 5 >>
[[Continue|Hospitalization and monitoring 1]]


:: Hospitalization and monitoring 1
Mr. Joseph stays in the hospital for more optimal management. You review and discuss with the medical team about chronic heart failure management.

Mr. Joseph is put on ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, spironolactone, and oral furosemide. Mr. Joseph also receives medical education sessions on how to take medications at home and help finding a primary care physician for long-term follow-up.

A month later, Mr. Joseph's son comes to the hospital to ask the nurse to see you.

He holds in his hand a wooden sculpture representing a stethoscope and tells you: "My father is doing much better with the new medication. He told me to give you this as a gift to eliminate the evil spirits that were harming him, he made it for you. Thank you for helping him!"

Congratulations! You have completed the first case!

The main points of heart failure management are:

After a physical examination, an ECG and an echocardiogram are necessary for the complete evaluation of suspected heart failure. A chest X-ray is less relevant if echocardiography is performed coupled with BNP testing. In the absence of these paraclinical examinations, it will help to check the condition of the lung parenchyma - detect cardiomegaly but does not rule out heart disease.

The best first step in management is to administer intravenous furosemide. Oral furosemide should be considered if IV form is not available, but the expected response may be delayed.
''However, beta-blockers and IV fluids should be avoided in acute decompensated heart failure, as they can worsen the patient's condition and increase ICU admissions.''

After initial stabilization, patients should be put on long-term treatment for heart failure before leaving the hospital. This ensures they are adequately managed, given the risk they may be lost to follow-up due to difficulties accessing care. Early discharge or inadequate treatment (e.g., oral diuretics only) could lead to poorer outcomes.

You can learn more about heart failure management by reading the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines. [[2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines|https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Acute-and-Chronic-Heart-Failure]].
