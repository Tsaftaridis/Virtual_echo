:: Case 3 introduction 

Kasozi is a 15-year-old teenage girl who lives in Kampala and comes to the hospital saying that she felt like she was suffocating during the night because of coughing and cannot sleep without 2 pillows for at least two weeks. She also has chest pain. 

She has been having fever and pain in her right knee, more than the left, for two days. After being asked, she remembers she had pain in her arm joints (elbows and shoulders) but she felt better with diclofenac, as well as having a recent throat cold. 

After trying everything she could, her best friend convinced her to come to the hospital in case there were medications that could help her.

/* Start of the workup choices. Trainee must pick "EKG" and "Echo" before the choice to move to treatment is actually open. If trainee chooses to move to treatment before that, he is reprimanded by the attending and loses one point in the score. Each choice either helps or hurts the trainee. Correct choices and incorrect choices are weighted so that picking all of them leads to a cancelling-out effect and the score is close to zero.*/
:: Physical Exam 3
<<set $diagnostics_3[0] to 1>> 
You begin a physical examination of the patient.

Physical Exam: There is a diastolic heart murmur. On pulmonary auscultation, you hear significant crackles at both bases; the abdominal exam is normal; there is slight edema of the lower limbs, and the pulse is normal. There is right knee tenderness, with no significant swelling. There are small, tough nodules on the arms. Neurological examination is normal. She does not have a fever.

One month later, Kasozi comes for a follow-up visit to renew her medication prescriptions. She tells you that the swelling in her legs has improved significantly and that she sleeps better at night. She thanks you for your help!

Congratulations! You have just completed the second case!

The diagnostic approach to a suspected underlying heart disease should involve a thorough history and a complete physical examination, as the symptoms are generally non-specific (cough, dyspnea, fatigue).

The cardiac echo can aid in diagnostic evaluation, showing left atrial dilation, pulmonary hypertension, and doming and restricted opening of the mitral valve. 

''The appropriate treatment for this patient includes diuretics to manage pulmonary edema, penicillin to prevent recurrence of acute rheumatic fever, and beta-blockers.''

In general, evaluation and management by a cardiologist are strongly recommended in cases of mitral stenosis, as treatment guidelines tend to be complex.

The next step in managing this patient is to refer her for mitral valve intervention, as severe mitral stenosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires urgent treatment.
